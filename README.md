# ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTISM SUPPORT

## Project Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects communication, emotional regulation, attention, and social interaction in children. Traditional therapy and assistive methods often lack personalization, real-time adaptability, and continuous monitoring, which limits their effectiveness across diverse behavioral needs.

This project proposes an **AI-assisted, cross-platform application** designed to support children aged **6–12 years** with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The system uses **emotion recognition, eye tracking, and speech-based cues** to understand a child’s emotional state and attention level in real time. Based on this analysis, the application provides **adaptive feedback through a virtual avatar** and **interactive therapeutic games**. The solution aims to improve emotional regulation, enhance engagement, and assist caregivers and therapists through progress tracking and alerts.
