# Detection of Pneumonia Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory disease that requires early and accurate diagnosis to reduce mortality rates. Traditional diagnosis using chest X-ray images depends on expert radiologists and can be time-consuming and subjective.

This project proposes a **deep learning–based system** to automatically detect pneumonia from **chest X-ray images** using pretrained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** models. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a fast and reliable diagnostic support tool.
